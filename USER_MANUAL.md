## 1. System Overview

The **Invertis Feedback System (TLFQ)** is a university-wide digital platform for collecting structured, anonymous student feedback on faculty performance — department-wise, section-wise, and semester-wise.

### How It Works

```
Super Admin
  └── Creates Departments, Coordinators, and HODs

Coordinator
  └── Creates Sections (e.g., BCS-3A, BTAI-5B)
  └── Adds Faculty and assigns them to Sections
  └── Pre-registers Students with a Student ID
  └── Manages Courses per Department

HOD (Head of Department)
  └── Creates Evaluation Forms (TLFQ) for each Section + Faculty
  └── Sets submission deadlines
  └── Opens or Closes the Department Portal
  └── Views department analytics

Student
  └── Logs in with Student ID (first time) → sets email + password
  └── Views evaluation forms assigned to their section
  └── Submits anonymous feedback for each faculty
```

---

## 2. How to Access the System

## 8. Troubleshooting

### "Student ID not found"
- Double-check the ID with your department coordinator
- Make sure you're entering it correctly (e.g., `BCS2025_01` not `bcs2025-01`)
- The ID is **case-insensitive** — `bcs2025_01` and `BCS2025_01` both work

### "Incorrect password"
- Staff: Use the email you were given when your account was created
- Students: Use the password you set during your first login
- Contact your Coordinator if you've forgotten your password — they can reset it

### "No forms available"
- The HOD may not have created forms for your section yet
- The department portal may be closed by the HOD
- All forms for your section may have reached their deadline

### "Portal is closed"
- The HOD has temporarily disabled submissions for your department
- Wait for the HOD to reopen the portal, or contact them directly

### Cannot access Admin/HOD panel
- You are logged in as the wrong role
- Log out and log in again with the correct email

### Server won't start
```bash
# Check if port 5000 is in use
netstat -ano | findstr :5000
# If something is using it, stop it or change PORT in .env

# Check MongoDB connection
# Make sure MONGO_URI in .env is correct
```

## 9. FAQ

**Q: Can a student see another student's responses?**
No. All responses are anonymous. Neither students, HODs, nor Coordinators can link a response back to a specific student.

**Q: Can I submit feedback more than once for the same faculty?**
No. Each form can only be submitted once per student. After submission, the form is locked.

**Q: Can an HOD see which student submitted what comment?**
No. Comments are stored without any student identifier. They are shown only in aggregate in analytics.

**Q: What happens when a form's deadline passes?**
The form is automatically hidden from students' dashboards. No new submissions are accepted.

**Q: Can a student change their email or password after activation?**
Contact your Coordinator — they can reset your account from the Coordinator Panel.

**Q: Can the Coordinator create forms?**
No. Only HODs can create, manage, and publish evaluation forms. The Coordinator manages the infrastructure (sections, faculty, students).

**Q: Can one faculty be assigned to multiple sections?**
Yes. A faculty member can be assigned to as many sections as needed, and separate TLFQ forms are created per section.

**Q: What does the Leaderboard show?**
The Leaderboard shows an **anonymized ranking** of faculty based on average feedback ratings. No personally identifying information is shown by default.
